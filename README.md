# windows-colemak

## Why?
Nothing's more frustrating than navigating to multiple sites to get set up on
Colemak from a QWERTY keyboard. I just needed a place that isn't colemak.com to
store what I need to get going fast.

## What?
This repo has the stanalone version of AutoHotKey which is also avalable in .zip
form from [here](https://autohotkey.com/download/).
Direct download [here](https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk.zip).

This also includes the unmaintained PKL app from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pkl/files/Standalone%20Layouts/)

More information about Colemak at [colemak.com](https://colemak.com).
