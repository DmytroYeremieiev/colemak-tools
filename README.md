# colemak-tools

This is a simple repo for me to aggregate all my Colemak resources.

![Colemak](https://colemak.com/wiki/images/e/ef/Colemak_fingers.png)

## Why?

Because I love to type with Colemak, and I want to have access to my tools
everywhere I compute.

Nothing's more frustrating than navigating all over the internet to get set up
on Colemak on a new machine, or having to figure out how to get productive
without administrative access. Or, finding evangelism resources. I just need
a place to store what I need to get going fast.

## Stuff in this repo

### AutoHotKey (Windows)

My AHK file for working with Windows machines is in this repo.

### Karabiner (macOS)

My Karabiner scripts are in this repo. The main one of interest is the Python
script for creating a Karabiner-Elements json config.
